//! Selective reverse proxy for the accelerated cache origin.
//!
//! In accelerated mode the runner overrides `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` at the local
//! server, but that one origin serves two Twirp services: `CacheService` (we
//! handle locally) and `ArtifactService` (used by `upload-artifact@v4`, which
//! must still reach real GitHub). [`proxied_app`] mounts the cache app's routes
//! locally and forwards everything else — verbatim, `Authorization` intact — to
//! the real upstream.
//!
//! The two failure domains are independent by construction: a connect/transport
//! failure to upstream yields `502` on the proxied (artifact) call only, while
//! the local cache routes keep serving from local NVMe.
