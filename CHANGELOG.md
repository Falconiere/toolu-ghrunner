## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Zero-arg `register` + per-repo runner layout.** `cd my-repo &&
  toolu-runner register` — the repository is inferred from the cwd git
  remote (`origin`, github.com), and the bearer chain (`--token` >
  `TOOLU_RUNNER_TOKEN` > stored login) now ends in an inline GitHub OAuth
  **device-flow login** on interactive terminals (`login`/`logout` remain as
  standalone commands). Each registration lives in its own
  `~/.toolu-runner/runners/<owner>/<repo>/` dir with a per-repo job lock, so
  runners for different repos run concurrently on one machine; the per-host
  login token store is shared at the runner home, and the legacy single-slot
  `config.toml` still works read-only. `run`/`status`/`remove`/`watch` resolve
  their registration the same way: `--config` flag > cwd inference > sole
  registration. `watch` browses job history across all runner dirs.
- **Self-documenting CLI help.** Every command and flag now carries full
  `--help` text: defaults stated everywhere (`--config`, `--work`, `--name`,
  `--labels`), env fallbacks documented (`TOOLU_RUNNER_TOKEN`,
  `TOOLU_RUNNER_CLIENT_ID`, `TOOLU_RUNNER_HOME`, `TOOLU_RUNNER_LOG` /
  `TOOLU_RUNNER_ALLOW_VERBOSE`), a single-use JIT warning on `register`, and
  Examples/Environment sections on the top-level help. Bare `toolu-runner`
  now prints the full help. The clap surface moved to a new `cli.rs` (with a
  startup `debug_assert` self-check in debug builds).
- **Automated releases (git-cliff).** A `cliff.toml` +
  `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` front half: a merge to `main` opens a
  version-bump + `CHANGELOG.md` release PR, and merging that PR pushes the
  `vX.Y.Z` tag (via `RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN`) that drives the existing
  tag-triggered `release.yml`. (Initially built on release-plz; replaced
  in-flight because its `git_only` mode cannot version unpublished
  workspaces with path-only internal deps — release-plz#2595.)
- **Cache acceleration (`ServicesMode::Accelerated`).** A new
  `[services] mode = "accelerated"` that turns the runner into a CI
  cache accelerator, alongside the existing `forwarder` and `offline`
  modes.
  - **Content-addressed store.** FastCDC-chunked, BLAKE3-addressed
    blobs on local NVMe, restart-safe (an append-only per-scope index
    that tolerates a torn trailing line). Identical archives collapse
    to shared chunks; every chunk is re-hashed on read so corruption is
    never served.
  - **Both cache protocols, one store.** Serves the v2 Twirp
    `CacheService` (`CreateCacheEntry` / `FinalizeCacheEntryUpload` /
    `GetCacheEntryDownloadURL`) and an Azure-Blob-compatible upload
    endpoint, and re-points the legacy v1 REST handlers at the same
    store — so `actions/cache@v4.0`–`v4.1` and `docker buildx`'s
    `type=gha` all hit the local cache instead of Azure.
  - **Selective reverse proxy.** Cache paths are served locally;
    `ArtifactService` and everything else is forwarded verbatim to the
    real `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` with the `Authorization` header passed
    through, so `upload-artifact@v4` still reaches GitHub. Upstream
    failure isolates artifacts from the cache.
  - **Branch-scoped trust.** Reads are global (chunks are
    content-verified); the index keeps GitHub's branch isolation, and a
    write to a protected branch from an untrusted event is soft-denied.
  - **Optional S3 cold tier** (`[cache.l2]`) mirroring immutable chunks
    and manifests off-box.
  - **Workspace GC** (`[workspace] gc_after_hours`) pruning stale
    per-job workspaces, and **shadow-mode step observation**
    (`[shadow] enabled`) recording would-hit / false-hit fingerprints —
    records only, never serves.

### Changed

- **Workspace reorganized into a 10-crate layered graph under `crates/`**
  (`protocol` → `shared` → `config` / `expressions` / `cache` →
  `wire` / `observability` → `execution` → `listener` → `toolu-runner`
  bin). `toolu-runner` is now bin-only; the execution engine lives in
  `execution` and the JIT lifecycle in `listener`. Behavior-preserving.
- *(shared)* drop YAMLESS_* legacy-env warning + coupling gate

### Documentation

- fix stale pre-split paths + test-comment accuracy
- *(toolu-runner)* precise debug-profile wording in self-check test comment
- *(toolu-runner)* document register's _diag pre-create in CLAUDE.md
- *(toolu-runner)* precise fork-PR safety wording for RULES_REF

### Fixed

- **`hashFiles()` now works.** The expression function was implemented but
  never registered with the dispatcher, so every `${{ hashFiles('**/x.lock') }}`
  failed with `unknown function` — while the README and architecture docs
  advertised it as supported. It is now wired, and its digest matches GitHub
  byte for byte.

  The previous implementation would also have produced the wrong value even
  once reachable. GitHub computes `SHA256(SHA256(file₁) ‖ SHA256(file₂) ‖ …)`,
  folding each file's **raw 32-byte** digest in traversal order; the old code
  hashed the concatenated file *contents*. Matching GitHub matters because
  `actions/cache` keys computed here must equal the keys a GitHub-hosted runner
  computes for the same tree, or every cache lookup misses.

  Also brought in line with `@actions/glob`: depth-first traversal with each
  directory's children in byte-wise name order (a full-path sort visits
  `a-b/Cargo.lock` before `a/Cargo.lock`, which GitHub does not), implicit
  `<pattern>/**` descendant twins, `!` negation, `#` comments, dotfiles matched
  by `*`, `..` rejected, matches outside the workspace skipped, symlinked
  directories never descended, and an optional leading
  `--follow-symbolic-links`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-18

The first release of toolu-runner. A standalone self-hosted GitHub
Actions runner written in Rust, extracted from
`yamless-runner`. Ships the full JIT listener protocol (RSA → JWT →
OAuth2 → broker session → message polling → job execution →
reporting), plus a single-job file-lock, a tracing layer with secret
redaction, and a CLI for register / run / remove / status.

### Added

**Workspace layout**

- 3-crate workspace: `shared`, `protocol`, `toolu-runner` (lib +
  bin). No yamless crates imported; no yamless env vars read.
- Strict dependency direction: `shared` is sync and I/O-free;
  `protocol` is sync, I/O-free, and network-free (no `reqwest`,
  `tokio`, `opendal`, `bollard`, `axum`); `toolu-runner` owns all
  async I/O. Enforced by `protocol/Cargo.toml` and CI.

**Listener (JIT protocol lifecycle)**

- JIT config parsing (`protocol::jit_config`) — decodes the 3-blob
  base64 envelope (`.runner` / `.credentials` /
  `.credentials_rsaparams`) into typed Rust structs.
- RSA key reconstruction (`protocol::auth::parse_rsa_private_key`)
  — PKCS#1 DER from `.NET RSACryptoServiceProvider` params, with
  CRT (exponent1, exponent2, coefficient) computation.
- JWT signing (`protocol::auth::build_jwt`) — PS256 with the
  standard GitHub Actions runner claims
  (sub/iss = clientId, aud = authorizationUrl, nbf/iat = now−30s,
  exp = now+4m30s).
- Token exchange (`toolu-runner::net::auth`) — POST to
  `authorization_url` with the JWT as
  `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.
- Session lifecycle (`protocol::session` + `net::session`) —
  `build_session_request`, `create_session`, `delete_session`.
- Long-poll message loop (`listener::job_lifecycle`) with
  exponential backoff (1s → 60s cap), BrokerMigration handling,
  cancel-token integration.
- Run Service (`net::run_service` + `reporting::run_service`) —
  `acquire_job` / `renew_job` / `complete_job` (every 60s renewal).
- Results Service Twirp (`net::results_service` +
  `reporting::results_service`) — `update_workflow_steps`,
  `create_job_logs_metadata`, `create_step_logs_metadata`,
  signed blob URLs.
- Log upload (`net::log_upload` + `listener::log_uploader`) —
  per-step log streaming + combined job-level log upload via
  Azure append-blob (create / block / commit).
- Live log WebSocket (`reporting::live_log::LiveLogStreamer`) —
  real-time log streaming to the GitHub Actions UI.
- GHES V1 support (`protocol::v1` + `net::v1`) — `connectionData`
  discovery, timeline record POST, `resolve_service_url` helper.
- V1 vs V2 protocol auto-detection — host `github.com` → V2, any
  other host → V1. Selected at `register` time.

**Execution engine**

- Step dispatch (`execution::handlers`) — script (shell), node
  (Node.js actions, auto-downloaded), docker (bollard), composite
  (composite actions). Plugin handler variant precedes built-ins.
- Expression engine (`execution::expressions`) — full `${{ }}`
  evaluator: lexer, AST parser with precedence + primary,
  evaluator, template, function library (builtins, hashFiles,
  JSON convert).
- Action resolution and download (`execution::actions` —
  `resolver`, `downloader`, `manifest`).
- Workflow parser (`execution::workflow::parser`) — jobs,
  triggers, raw types.
- Build matrix (`execution::workflow::matrix`).
- Job graph + orchestration (`execution::workflow::job_graph`,
  `orchestrator`).
- Reusable workflows (`execution::workflow::reusable`) — `uses:
  org/repo/.github/workflows/x.yml` resolution with output
  propagation.
- Artifacts (`execution::artifacts`) — upload + download via
  Azure append-blob. `backend` + `service` with `handlers` /
  `lifecycle`.
- Cache (`execution::cache`) — local disk + remote layered
  backend. `key`, `trust`, `service` with `handlers` /
  `lifecycle`.
- OIDC token issuance (`execution::oidc`) — local server +
  claims.
- Secret masker (`execution::secret_masker::SecretMasker`) —
  registers secrets from job Variables (`IsSecret=true`) and
  MaskHints, splits on newlines, auto-registers JSON-escaped
  variants. Wired into the tracing layer via
  `shared::startup::SecretRedactor`.

**Runtime**

- Single-job file lock (`lockfile.rs`) — exclusive `fs2` lock on
  `~/.toolu-runner/.lock`. JSON body
  (`pid` / `started_at` / `config_path`). Stale-lock recovery
  via `is_pid_alive` (sysinfo) + mtime > 5 min. Released on
  graceful shutdown and on panic (via `Drop`).
- Tracing init (`shared::startup`) — `tracing-subscriber` +
  `EnvFilter` (TOOLU_RUNNER_LOG → RUST_LOG → info). JSON file
  sink at `data_dir/_diag/<service>.log` (daily-rotated), pretty
  stderr sink. Line-level secret redaction via
  `RedactingMakeWriter` + `RedactingWriter`.
- Cancellation token wiring — `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`
  built in `toolu-runner run`, bridged to SIGINT / SIGTERM, and
  listened on by the poll loop, the renewal task, and the
  in-flight job. `--once` triggers a 100ms delayed cancel for
  test mode.

**Docker / Node / Plugin**

- Docker client (`docker::client`) — bollard wrapper for daemon
  connection.
- Service containers (`docker::services`) — service container
  lifecycle.
- Host ↔ container path mapping (`docker::path_translator`).
- Node.js runtime (`node::runtime`) — version detection +
  download + cache at `data_dir/_node/<version>`.
- Plugin system (`plugin::RunnerPlugin` + `PluginRegistry`) — new
  addition not in upstream `actions/runner`.

**CLI (`toolu-runner`)**

- `register` — validates `--url`, probes the JIT endpoint with a
  5s HEAD, computes the protocol version from the host, writes
  `config.toml` (TOML, 0600) + `credentials.json` (JSON, 0600) to
  `~/.toolu-runner/`.
- `run` — loads config + credentials, acquires `.lock`,
  constructs `GitHubListener`, wires SIGINT/SIGTERM, runs until
  cancel.
- `remove` — refuses and writes `.pending_remove` if `.lock` is
  held (unless `--force`); otherwise deletes persisted state.
- `status` — prints config summary without network access.
- Subcommand flags (`register` / `run` / `remove` / `status`) —
  matches `toolu-runner --help` output.

**Service install**

- `scripts/io.toolu-runner.plist` — launchd agent for macOS. Sets
  `TOOLU_RUNNER_LOG=info`, redirects stdout / stderr to
  `_diag/launchd-*.log`.
- `scripts/toolu-runner.service` — systemd unit for Linux. Runs
  as `toolu-runner` user with hardened sandboxing
  (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateTmp`,
  `ProtectHome`, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`, …), `Restart=always`,
  logs to the journal under `SyslogIdentifier=toolu-runner`.
- `scripts/test/plist_test.sh` and `scripts/test/systemd_test.sh`
  — smoke checks that the unit files parse.

**Install + tooling**

- `install.sh` — installs from GitHub releases. Detects arch
  (x86_64 / arm64) and OS (darwin / linux), downloads the
  matching release artifact, installs to `/usr/local/bin/`
  (or `--install-dir`), optionally installs the service unit
  with `--service`. `--check` prints the plan without downloading.
- `tools/check.sh` — local quality gate (cargo fmt + clippy +
  file-size ≤ 150 + no-allow + no-unwrap).
- `lefthook.yml` — `pre-commit` runs fmt + clippy; `pre-push`
  runs `./tools/check.sh all`.

**Release automation**

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven release automation. On
  a `v*` tag push: asserts the tag matches the `Cargo.toml` version,
  runs the fmt/clippy/test gate, builds on four native runners
  (`darwin` / `linux` × `amd64` / `arm64`), packages one
  `toolu-runner-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` per target (binary + `scripts/`
  service files), computes `SHA256SUMS`, and publishes a GitHub
  Release with notes from this file's matching section. Tags with a
  `-` publish as prereleases. A tag-keyed `concurrency` group covers
  the whole chain. The workflow never writes to the repo.
- `scripts/assert-version.sh` — asserts a release tag matches the
  `[workspace.package]` version.
- `scripts/package-release.sh` — assembles the per-target tarball in
  the exact layout `install.sh` expects.
- `scripts/changelog-extract.sh` — extracts a version's section from
  this file for the GitHub Release notes.
- `.github/workflows/release-finalize.yml` — post-publish smoke test.
  Downloads each target's tarball + `SHA256SUMS` back off the release
  and verifies the checksum, a size floor, and the `tar` member
  layout, catching upload corruption that `publish` cannot see.
- `.github/workflows/release-homebrew.yml` — publishes
  `Formula/toolu-runner.rb` to
  [`Falconiere/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/Falconiere/homebrew-tap)
  after a stable release (skipped for prereleases), via
  `scripts/generate-homebrew-formula.sh` and a `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`
  PAT.
- Both of the above are `on: workflow_call:` reusable workflows,
  chained off `publish` with `needs:` rather than triggered by
  `on: release: [published]`. A release created by a workflow step
  using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` emits no `release` event, so the
  event-triggered form could never fire. A called workflow is granted
  `github.token` automatically but sees no other secret unless the
  caller passes it; `release.yml` passes `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` and
  nothing else, rather than using `secrets: inherit` (which would
  forward every repo secret to a workflow that pushes to an external
  repo).
- `.github/actionlint.yaml` — declares the `toolu-runner-v1`
  self-hosted label so `actionlint` validates the `*-live.yml`
  workflows instead of erroring on an unknown runner label.
- `scripts/test/{assert_version,changelog_extract,package_release,release_workflow,release_finalize_workflow,generate_homebrew_formula,release_homebrew_workflow}_test.sh`
  — real-data tests for the release scripts + workflows, run in CI.
  The workflow tests assert the chained shape and reject any
  `github.event.release` expression in a reusable workflow.

**Tests**

- 196 tests across `shared`, `protocol`, `toolu-runner`
  (5 CLI, 12 failure modes, 4 listener smoke, 3 net, 16 storage
  layout, 5 shared config, 3 shared error, 5 shared events, 4
  shared startup-redaction, 15 shared job-message, 3 protocol
  auth, 3 protocol integration).

**Documentation**

- `README.md` — install, register, run, remove, status, service
  install, env vars, config schema, troubleshooting.
- `CLAUDE.md` — module map, crate-specific rules.
- `docs/architecture.md` — design + sequence diagrams for
  register / run / cancel / reconnect.
- `docs/known-bugs.md` — B-001 (5-min cancellation watchdog),
  B-002 (live unregistration), B-003 (live register POST).

### Removed

- **yamless-orchestrator WebSocket client** (`serve/`, `ws_client/`,
  `command_handler/`, `connect.rs`, `infra.rs`, `lifecycle.rs`)
  — the runner has no orchestrator service to talk to.
- **yamless-specific step handlers** — `yamless`,
  `yamless_deploy`, `yamless_notify`, `yamless_test_report` (and
  their `HandlerKind::Yamless` dispatch variant).
- **`build_tool_*` modules** — yamless build-tool registry
  (`build_tool_detection`, `build_tool_endpoints`,
  `build_tool_storage`).

- **`yamless-auth` CLI** — device-flow authentication. Replaced
  by GitHub's registration-token flow at `toolu-runner register`.
- **OpenTelemetry / OTLP** — replaced by `tracing-subscriber` +
  `EnvFilter` + JSON file sink.
- **`yamless-shared` workspace dependency** — replaced by the
  local `shared` crate.
- **`YAMLESS_*` env var compatibility** — the old prefix has no
  special handling: not detected, no warning, no effect on runner
  behavior.
