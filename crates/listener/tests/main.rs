//! The single `listener` integration-test binary (#109).
//!
//! Every file in `tests/` is declared here as a module, so Cargo compiles and
//! links one executable instead of one per file (`autotests = false` in
//! `Cargo.toml`). Test names therefore carry the file stem as a module prefix:
//! `cargo test -p listener --test integration -- loop_decision_test::`.
